### Note for New Users
You don't need React or .NET development experience to run this application. Docker takes care of all dependencies and setup for you! As long as you have Docker installed, you can run the entire application stack without installing React, Node.js, .NET SDK, or SQL Server on your local machine.

### Installation & Setup

#### Option 1: Using Docker Hub Images

1. **Create a docker-compose.yml file** with the following content (adjust as needed):
   ```bash
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     backend:
       image: yourusername/homedecor-backend:latest
       ports:
         - "5236:80"
       environment:
         - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
       networks:
         - ecommerce-net
       volumes:
         - ./Uploads:/app/Uploads
       depends_on:
         db:
           condition: service_healthy
       restart: unless-stopped
     frontend:
       image: yourusername/homedecor-frontend:latest
       ports:
         - "5173:5173"
       environment:
         - CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
       networks:
         - ecommerce-net
       depends_on:
         - backend
     db:
       image: yourusername/homedecor-sqlserver:latest
       environment:
         - "ACCEPT_EULA=Y"
         - "SA_PASSWORD=Admin123@"
         - "MSSQL_PID=Developer"
         - "MSSQL_AGENT_ENABLED=true"
         - "MSSQL_TCP_PORT=1433"
       ports:
         - "1433:1433"
       volumes:
         - mssql-data:/var/opt/mssql
       networks:
         - ecommerce-net
       healthcheck:
         test: /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P "$SA_PASSWORD" -Q "SELECT 1" || exit 1
         interval: 10s
         timeout: 3s
         retries: 10
         start_period: 10s
       restart: unless-stopped
   networks:
     ecommerce-net:
       driver: bridge
   volumes:
     mssql-data:
   ```

2. **Pull and run using Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

#### Option 2: Building Locally from Source

1. **Clone the repository** (if using Git)
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd home-decor-ecommerce
   ```

2. **Environment setup**
   - No additional environment setup is needed as all required configurations are included in the Docker Compose file.

3. **Start the application with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This command will:
   - Build and start the frontend, backend, and database containers
   - Create necessary networks and volumes
   - Configure all services to communicate with each other

4. **Verify the application is running**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5236
   - API Documentation (Swagger): http://localhost:5236/swagger

## üìã Usage Guide

### Container Images on Docker Hub
The application images are available on Docker Hub:

- Frontend: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mariamkilany4/ecommerce-frontend
- Backend:  https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mariamkilany4/ecommerce-backend
- Database: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mariamkilany4/ecommerce-db

### Accessing the Application
Once all containers are up and running:

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
2. You can browse products without creating an account
3. To add items to cart or wishlist, you'll need to create an account or login

### Creating an Account
1. Click on the "Sign Up" link in the navigation
2. Fill in the required information
3. Submit the form to create your account

### Shopping
1. Browse products on the home page or by category
2. Click on a product to view details
3. Add products to your cart or wishlist using the icons
4. View your cart to adjust quantities or remove items
5. Proceed to checkout when ready to complete your purchase

## üîß Development Guide

### Project Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ back/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ E-Commerce/         # .NET Backend
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dockerfile      # Backend Docker build file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ front/                  # React Frontend
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dockerfile          # Frontend Docker build file

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sql.dockerfile          # SQL Server Docker build file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This file
```

### Making Changes
- **Frontend**: Changes in the `front` directory will be automatically reflected due to volume mounting and hot-reloading
- **Backend**: Changes to the backend code require rebuilding the container:
  ```bash
  docker-compose build backend
  docker-compose up -d backend
  ```

### Publishing to Docker Hub
If you've made changes and want to update the Docker Hub images:

```bash
# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Build and tag images
docker-compose build

# Tag images
docker tag home-decor-ecommerce-frontend:latest yourusername/homedecor-frontend:latest
docker tag home-decor-ecommerce-backend:latest yourusername/homedecor-backend:latest
docker tag home-decor-ecommerce-db:latest yourusername/homedecor-sqlserver:latest

# Push images to Docker Hub
docker push yourusername/homedecor-frontend:latest
docker push yourusername/homedecor-backend:latest
docker push yourusername/homedecor-sqlserver:latest
```

### Database Access
- The SQL Server database runs on port 1433
- Connection string is defined in the backend configuration
- You can connect using SQL Server Management Studio or any compatible tool:
  - Server name: localhost,1433
  - Authentication: SQL Server Authentication
  - Login: sa
  - Password: Admin123@

## üõë Stopping the Application

To stop and remove the running containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop and remove containers along with volumes (will delete database data):
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: If ports 5173, 5236, or 1433 are already in use on your machine, modify the port mappings in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. **Database connection issues**: If the backend cannot connect to the database, ensure the SQL Server container is healthy:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
   If the database shows as unhealthy, check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs db
   ```

3. **Frontend not loading**: Check if the frontend container is running and check its logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs frontend
   ```

### For Non-Developers
If you're not familiar with React, .NET, or Docker concepts:

1. **Simple restart solution**: Most issues can be fixed by restarting the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Viewing the application**: Just open your web browser and go to:
   - http://localhost:5173

3. **First-time setup**: The first time you run the application might take several minutes while Docker downloads and builds the necessary components.

4. **No development tools needed**: You don't need to install any development tools or make any code changes - Docker handles everything!
